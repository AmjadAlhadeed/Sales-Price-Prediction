# House Price Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

This project involves the development and evaluation of a machine learning model to predict house prices based on a dataset containing various features like living area, overall quality, year built, and more. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature selection, handling multicollinearity, and applying multiple linear regression to build an accurate predictive model. The project also ensures the model adheres to key assumptions of linear regression through residual analysis and Q-Q plots. Key tests like Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's test are performed to evaluate statistical significance among categorical features.

Key features:  

  -Data preprocessing and handling of missing values
  -Multicollinearity resolution through Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
  -Multiple linear regression model for house price prediction
  -Evaluation of model assumptions using residual plots
  -Statistical tests to analyze categorical feature significance
